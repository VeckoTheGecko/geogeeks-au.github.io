You’re invited to an evening of short talks from people using a variety of open source tools and datasets.
We’ll hear about building QField templates for geological mapping, striving for accurate road visualisation using OpenStreetMap data and more!

This is a free casual event and there’ll be plenty of time to chat over pizza and drinks. Everyone is welcome!

Please register so we can cater well :)

The speakers are:

* **Julien Perret:** Towards the harmonization of digital field data entry for geological mapping: an in-house QGIS-QField-based template 
* **Ben Ritter:** OSM's big forking problem: OSM centerlines to full streets
