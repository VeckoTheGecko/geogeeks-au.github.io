   - Geogeeks is a Perth-based meetup group for people interested in hacking on geospatial projects using (mostly) open source tools and data. We'll be working on anything that involves a sense of place - after all, <em>everything happens somewhere</em>.
   - All geogeeks are welcome to join our hack nights, from seasoned pros to complete newbs. The objective is to learn, to teach, and to build in a fun & collaborative working environment. Bring along a laptop and ideas for projects to work on.
   - "Want to learn new things, have fun, and make something? To hear about hack nights & events:"
