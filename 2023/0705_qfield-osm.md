Come join us for a casual evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners.
We'll learn about a range of topics centred on open source tools and datasets, and have opportunity to meet fellow open geospatial enthusiasts!
All are welcome.

The speakers are:

* **Ben Ritter:** OpenStreetMap's big forking problem: OSM centrelines to full streets
* **Julien Perret:** Towards the harmonization of digital field data entry for geological mapping: an in-house QGIS-QField-based template
* **Mark Jessell:** Delivering data using GeoServer with TerriaMap and custom systems

After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!
