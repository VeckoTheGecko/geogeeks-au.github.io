description:
  - We meet every second Thursday evening at <a href="https://spacecubed.com/" target="_blank">Spacecubed</a> for a few hours of geogeekery.
  - It's still early days, but so far, we've already had a hands-on PostGIS workshop, started a substantial project, and helped each other solve some problems.
  - Over the next few hack nights, we're going to work on our historic maps project, and potentially unearth another project or two to dive into
